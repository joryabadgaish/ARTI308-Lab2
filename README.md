# ARTI308 – Lab 2

## Dataset Description
This project uses an email dataset that contains information related to email messages and their classifications. 
The dataset is structured in tabular format and includes multiple attributes describing email content and labels.

- Dataset format: CSV
- Dataset type: Structured
- Number of records: Shown in the notebook
- Source: Kaggle

## Machine Learning Problem
The dataset is suitable for a **classification problem**.
The goal is to classify emails into predefined categories (such as spam or non-spam) based on their features.

## Methodology
The machine learning workflow follows these steps:
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model selection
4. Training and validation
5. Evaluation
6. Final model

The methodology diagram illustrates the complete process from data collection to final model selection, including iterative evaluation and validation stages.
